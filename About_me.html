                <blockquote><p>
                    I am a junior (Class of '22) Texas A&M computer science major and business minor from Tomball, 
                    Texas (NW of Houston). Outside of school I love to play on the Texas A&M ultimate club Frisbee team, 
                    hang out with friends, and explore lots of new software engineering topics such as Web-design, and 
                    data analytics. I also love to travel especially cruising, watch any sport, and spend time with my 
                    family as much as I can. If you know me then you know that I pride my self on dedication, 
                    hard work, being able to work successfully in a team environment and to overcome any obstacle that 
                    life throws at me. Even though i'm not perfect I strive to succeed in something little or big in my 
                    life everyday and be a light to God in everything I do. This summer (2020) I took the initiative to go 
                    out and learn more about computer science. I immediately fell in love with front-end development and 
                    created various projects this to reflect that. If you move over to my portfolio 
                    you can see my plane tracker project which is what gave me that urge to learn more about front-end 
                    development, my blackjack game which is my first independent front-end project where I got to learn all 
                    about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is the project that got me really excited for front-end development. 
                    And lastly my Covid-19 Tracker which is really where I got to put these new found skills to the test and 
                    really got to create something that I felt could make a difference in 
                    the world. Outside of web-development I hope to learn more about other fields such as data science, and 
                    machine learning and hope to build a project one day where I can throw all of these skills together to 
                    make something really impactful so that I can help others. I am currently looking for a internship in any 
                    of these fields for summer 2021, that could give me a opportunity to showcase my skills and make a difference 
                    in the world.</p></blockquote>
